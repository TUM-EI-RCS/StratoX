This script generates statistics about units of a mixed Ada/SPARK project
It reads the *.spark files in the gnatprove output

# Shortcomings
 - subs which are hidden within a SPARK_Mode => off zone are not counted
 - generics are not listed separately, but instead to the place of instantiation
 - 

# TODO
 - lookup entity type for each VC: separate between Float and Int overflows
 - gnuplot
