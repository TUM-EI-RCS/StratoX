Ref: U-Blox-8-M8 Receiver


The u-blox receiver always uses only the Current Configuration.
Unless the Current Configuration is made permanent by using UBX-CFG-CFG as described below, the Current
Configuration will be lost when there is:
• a power cycle
• a hardware reset
• a (complete) controlled software reset


Protocols:
NMEA (Strings), UBX (proprietary binary), RTCM(Real Time correction data, input only)

UBX:
* Every Message starts with 2 Bytes: 0xB5 0x62
* 1 Byte Class Field
* 1 Byte ID
* 2 Bytes Payload Length
* Payload
* 2 Bytes Checksum

All multi-byte values are ordered in Little Endian format

For each message the receiver will send an "acknowledge" (ACK-AC
K) or a "not acknowledge" (ACK-NAK) message back to the sender


Configuration:
https://github.com/PX4/GpsDrivers/blob/5c1ae956552c3887c5fddd303a8f242efa715333/src/ubx.cpp#L106

1. Set binary protocol (CFG-PRT, own message)
2. Set baudrate (CFG-PRT, again own message)
3. Set message rates (CFG-MSG)
4. set dynamic model



Important Messages:

CFG-PRT: set protocol
CFG-MSG: set message rates
CFG-NAV5: set dynamic model (to airborne) 

MSG_POSLLH: long, lat, alt
NAV-PVT: long, lat, alt, all velocities, time, HEADING OF VEHICLE! (in deg)
